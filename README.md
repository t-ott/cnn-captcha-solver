# CNN CAPTCHA Solver

**Package to crack simple CAPTCHA images with a convolutional neural network (CNN). Built with OpenCV and PyTorch. [Refer to the demonstration notebook that utilizes the ```cnn_captcha_solver``` package here](https://github.com/t-ott/cnn-captcha-solver/blob/master/demonstration.ipynb).**

This project is [cross-posted on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tommyott/cnn-captcha-solver-97-8-accuracy). The approach I took was directly informed by Adam Geitgey's blog post ["How to break a CAPTCHA system in 15 minutes with Machine Learning"](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/how-to-break-a-captcha-system-in-15-minutes-with-machine-learning-dbebb035a710).
